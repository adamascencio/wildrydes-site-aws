# Building a Serverless Web Application on AWS

This tutorial from AWS teaches how to build a serverless web application on AWS using a combination of services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Cognito. 

By following the tutorial, I'll learn how to create a web application that allows users to register, log in, and upload images. The tutorial also covers how to store the images in Amazon S3, how to use Amazon DynamoDB to store user data, and how to secure your application with Amazon Cognito.

The tutorial is divided into several modules, and each module covers a specific aspect of building the web application. The modules include:

- Setting up the AWS environment
- Creating the AWS Lambda function
- Creating the Amazon API Gateway
- Creating the Amazon S3 bucket
- Creating the Amazon DynamoDB table
- Creating the Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool
- Building the web application

At the end of the tutorial, I'll have a fully functional web application that is deployed on AWS and can be accessed via the internet.
